  <h2>About My Self</h2>
  <P><em><b>HEY</b>, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about <strong> MYSELF </strong>. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what
      kind of image you have about
      me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</em></P>
  <p>I am a person who is <STRONG>POSITIVE</STRONG> about every aspect of <B>LIFE</B>. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to <b>EXPERIENCE</b>. I like to <b>READ</b>, I like to <b>WRITE</b>; I like to <b>THINK</b>, I like to
    <b>DREAM</b>; I like to <b>TALK</b>, I like to <b>LISTEN</b>. I like to see the <b>SUNRISE</b> in the morning, I like to see the <b>MOONLIGHT</b> at night; I like to feel the <b>MUSIC</b> flowing on my face, I like to <b>SMELL</b> the wind coming
